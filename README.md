## Overview

This is a React version of a [solution](https://github.com/Saeadyou/g-o-thrones) to a skill level test which I had done with Vanilla JS. I created a Single Page Application (SPA) that displays houses, people and quotes from the series Game of Thrones (GOT).
[The API](https://gameofthronesquotes.xyz/) was used for this.
